# Changelog

All notable changes to `simple-harness-memory-sdk` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation
- README quickstart restructured so the basic example runs under a plain `pip install -e .`
  (append + recall + facts); world model and BGE-M3 embedding moved to an "optional capabilities"
  section with their exact extras and weight-download prerequisites.
- Documented the default HashEmbedder as a deterministic hash pseudo-vector (not semantic);
  production semantic recall requires the `[embeddings]` extra.

### Tooling
- Added `scripts/verify_quickstart.sh`, a release gate that installs into a clean venv and executes
  the README quickstart block verbatim (no paraphrase), reporting a structured PASS/FAIL.
